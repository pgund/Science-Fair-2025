### This is the repository for all **documents**, **data**, and **code**, for myscience fair project.

This project will first compete in the [*Shrewsbury Public High School*](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/high) fair, then it will compete in [*WRFSEF*](https://www.wrsef.net/), after the regional fair it will compete in [*MSEF*](https://scifair.com/), after the state fair it will compete in [*ISEF*](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/). Of course this all depends on the performance of my project.
