### Artificial Intelligence-Driven Detection of Genetic Mutations in Genes Producing Cancerous Proteins Leading to Glioblastoma Multiforme Using Genomic Data

### Overview

This is the repository for all **documents**, **data**, and **code** for my science fair project. The project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to detect genetic mutations in genes that produce cancerous proteins, specifically those leading to Glioblastoma Multiforme, using genomic data.

### Objectives

- Develop an AI model to analyze genomic data.
- Identify genetic mutations associated with Glioblastoma Multiforme.
- Validate the model's accuracy and reliability.
- Present findings in a clear and comprehensive manner.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather genomic data from publicly available databases.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Model Development**: Develop and train an AI model to detect genetic mutations.
4. **Validation**: Validate the model using a separate dataset.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze the results and identify significant mutations.
6. **Documentation**: Document the entire process and findings.

### Competition

This project will first compete in the [Shrewsbury Public High School](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/high) fair. If successful, it will advance to the [WRFSEF](https://www.wrsef.net/). Following the regional fair, it will compete in the [MSEF](https://scifair.com/). If it performs well at the state level, it will move on to the [ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/). The progression through these competitions will depend on the project's performance at each stage.

### Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains all the genomic data used for the project.
- **/code**: Includes all the scripts and code for data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.
- **/documents**: Holds all the documentation related to the project, including reports and presentations.
