### Artificial Intelligence-Driven Detection of Genetic Mutations in Genes Producing Cancerous Proteins Leading to Glioblastoma Multiforme Using Genomic Data

### Overview

This is the repository for all **documents**, **data**, and **code**, for my science fair project.

### Competition

This project will first compete in the [Shrewsbury Public High School](https://schools.shrewsburyma.gov/high) fair, then it will compete in [WRFSEF](https://www.wrsef.net/), after the regional fair it will compete in [MSEF](https://scifair.com/), after the state fair it will compete in [ISEF](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/). Of course this all depends on the performance of my project.
